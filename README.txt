This is a game I made using C++. It uses the SFML library. All other code is provided by me.
Compiled for windows.

To launch the game you just need to go into the stellar prospects folder and launch the exe.
This is a game demo I made over a month using only C++.
The game is about mining asteroids in an asteroid field over the course of a year.
Good luck!

Source code can be found in the SpaceGame folder attached. It is a visual studio project. 
If you want to see the game running, I suggest just running the exe provided instead of compiling the project yourself.
